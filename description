Hello !

This repository is just about to save it and explain the objective and how this works. I'm a begginer, so its pretty simple ;)

The main problem is: When you have large areas and long temporal intervals for filtering landsat 8 images it gets so hard to select
and download them. So, i made up this code in R for filtering and clustering. The filters are based in Land Cloud Cover and the clusters 
in a date range that can be defined for each purpose. After I get the cluster, a list of Scene Identifiers can be generated; with this 
list there's an module in python that easily download the scenes and with a simple for loop we can set the download of hunndred of scenes.
The repository for download is from a guy called Yann Forget, with his 'landsatxplore' module (I'm new at Github so i dont know yet how
to link him, sorry).

I need two inputs for this code to run: 

1. The metadata table that can be generated after a search in the site https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/. This table has all atributes of
each scene, like Acquisition time, cloud cover, time of capture, etc. So, you select the area, the filters, and search.
  -> In the site, look for: 'Click here to export your results' , here is where you will find this table.
  
2. There's a shapefile with the route of landsat 8 satelites, this route is descripted as WRS-2 and has every position of capturing
scenes for the landsat 7 & landsat 8. With this file, you can select only the tiles that you want. If the areas get so big, you can use
the tool 'select by location' and intersect the shape with another polygon containing the area of a country, continent, etc. Ok, in the 
end, will be needed only the selected tiles and from this, an .txt export from selected features. So, here's the second input for the code.
  -> The shapefile with WRS-2 (Worldwide Reference System) can be downloaded from: https://landsat.usgs.gov/pathrow-shapefiles
